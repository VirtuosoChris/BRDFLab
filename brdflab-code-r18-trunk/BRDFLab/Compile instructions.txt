Compile instructions

- Check out the last revision of BRDFLab: svn co https://brdflab.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/brdflab brdflab
- Download dependencies from https://sourceforge.net/projects/brdflab/files/
- Copy the dependencies folders into BRDFLab dir (e.g. trunk/BRDFLab/)
- Install Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/) and Ogre (http://www.ogre3d.org/). 
	- Be sure to have the environment variable OGRE_SOURCE pointing to the OGRE source root and the OGRE_BUILD 
	  variable pointing to the build dir where you compiled Ogre.
	- If you don't have Boost installed, you should set the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to the directory 
	  that comes with OGRE (e.g. $OGRE_HOME/boost_1_xx). 
	- For Qt, you might need to add the path to "qmake.exe" to the PATH environment variable (usually found 
	  under QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.x.x/xxxxxx/bin).
- In order to create the BRDFLab MSVC project, you will require CMake.
	- Open CMake (cmake-gui).
	- Select the root folder where you performed the checkout as the source dir (e.g. trunk/) and the build 
	  directory included with BRDFLab as the building directory (trunk/build/).
	- Click on Configure and then Generate.
- Build BRDFLab. For MSVC, the solution file generated by CMake can be found in the build directory.
- Finally, you will have to copy the required DLLs to build/BRDFLab/release and build/BRDFLab/debug/.
	- Some DLLs are already included in the svn (blas, lapack, imdebug).
	- Ogre, NLopt and QtPropertyBrowser DLLs can be included by adding the corresponding paths to the PATH 
	  environment variable.
	- For Qt, we recommend to copy the required DLLs in the corresponding directories (mainly QtCore4.dll, 
	  QtGui4.dll, QtXml4.dll, QtNetwork4.dll for release version, and similar DLLs (*d.dll) for debug version). 
	- You can check which DLLs are required in the binary release of BRDFLab.

See README.txt for additional information.
